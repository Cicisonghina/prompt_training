It was 3:17 AM. My baby had just woken up. Again.

Rocking him in my arms, exhausted, I whispered: "Sleep, little bug, sleep..."

And then I realized something:
Being a mom is exactly like being a PM. But worse. And infinitely more beautiful.

‚Ü≥ My "users" have unpredictable needs
‚Ü≥ My sprints run 24/7
‚Ü≥ My critical backlog: "Baby wakes up every night" (status: Open since forever)

So I decided to write about it.

üöÄ Launching "Project Manager & Mom" - a series mixing personal stories, tech metaphors, and cold tea (because I never have time to finish it hot).

First article: "Welcome to My Personal Backlog"
‚û°Ô∏è https://medium.com/@cecidimaulo/project-manager-mom-0-welcome-to-my-personal-backlog-db1b6b702f27

For all those juggling between career and motherhood.
For everyone who thinks parenting skills don't "count."

Spoiler: They do. Enormously.
