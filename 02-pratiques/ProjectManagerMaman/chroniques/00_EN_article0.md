## 1. The Night Everything Changed

It was 3:17 AM. No baby monitor needed‚Äîour apartment is too small for that, and besides, the walls wouldn't have protected me from the screaming anyway. My eldest, 27 months old, was finally asleep, but the baby had just woken up with a start, like a process crashing for no reason. I got up silently, bare feet on the cold tiles, my heart already heavy. No anger, no "You won this round, little monster." Just a dull exhaustion, and this thought: "What if I can't handle this? What if, this time, I don't have the strength?"

In his room, he was in his crib, red cheeks, eyes bright with tears or surprise‚ÄîI couldn't tell. I picked him up and started singing, my voice trembling:

*"Sleep, little bug, sleep..."*

An improvised lullaby, somewhere between plea and inside joke. Because if I didn't laugh at this situation, I'd cry. And that night, I'd already cried enough.

That's when, rocking my son against me, I had a revelation: this chaos, these nights, these doubts... they were also a form of skill. A skill I could someday reinvest in my career. What if I wrote about this?

## 2. From PM to Mom: Same Battle?

My name is Cecilia. Before, I was working in tech. Today, I'm at home with my two boys‚Äîa 9-month-old baby who explores the world through screams and smiles, and a 27-month-old toddler whose favorite word, "NO," echoes like a 404 Not Found in my head.

I chose to put my career on pause, but not my ambitions. This series, "Project Manager & Mom," was born from an obvious truth: my current "product" is my family. My users have unpredictable needs, non-existent feedback loops (or incomprehensible ones), and sprints that run 24/7.

My current backlog looks like this:
- **[Epic]** *"Find balance between motherhood and professional projects"* (status: In Progress)
- **[User Story]** *"Get my toddler to eat vegetables"* (priority: High, status: Eternally Blocked)  
- **[Critical Bug]** *"Baby wakes up every night"* (severity: Critical, status: Open since forever)

If I can manage this, I can manage any backlog. Someday.

## 3. Why This Series Exists

**To reclaim my place in tech**: Document that parenting skills are professional skills. Crisis management, prioritization under extreme constraints, communication with non-verbal "users"... Sound familiar?

**To de-dramatize daily life**: Parenting is 90% crisis management and 10% magical moments. Writing is my way of transforming this vulnerability into strength. And maybe helping other parents feel less alone.

**To create an authentic portfolio**: A mix of personal stories, tech analysis, and practical templates. Because if I can document how to survive a sleepless night, I can document any process.

## 4. What's Coming (or: My Product Roadmap)

Here's what awaits you, presented as user stories:

- **"InfernalOps Nights"**: *"As a mom, I want to understand sleep regressions to limit nighttime outages"*
- **"Snack MVP"**: *"How to iterate to find THE combination my toddler will accept (spoiler: it changes daily)"*
- **"Parental Production Incidents"**: *"My runbook for managing 8 PM fever, explosive diapers, and stroller refusal"*
- **"The Diaper Kanban"**: *"When your closet becomes an Agile dashboard"*

## 5. The Cold Tea Manifesto

I don't drink coffee. I drink tea. Cold, most of the time, because I forget it between a feeding and a toddler crisis. Sometimes over-steeped, sometimes lukewarm, but always there, like a reassuring constant in my chaos.

Tea is my metaphor for this period of my life:
- Over-steeped? Like those days when everything goes wrong
- Cold? Like my hopes for productivity
- Comforting despite everything? Like a baby hug after a meltdown

(And if you also prefer tea, know that you're in good company. Real heroes don't drink coffee. They drink cold tea and survive anyway.)

## 6. And Now?

If you too have ever:
- Cried silently after a sleepless night  
- Negotiated with a toddler like with an impossible stakeholder
- Dreamed of becoming yourself again, even for just an hour

...then this series is for you.
