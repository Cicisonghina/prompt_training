# Parental Resource Management: When My Kids Turn Me Into an RTS

## 1. Critical Multi-tasking Detected at 7:23 AM

This morning, 7:23 AM, I'm in full intensive micro-management mode. My baby is screaming for his toast while throwing the previous one on the floor, my toddler is running around with an overflowing diaper categorically refusing to be changed, and my dog is barking louder and louder to go out.

I'm inventing a pathetic dance while trying to cook eggs that my older son "doesn't want" but will surely devour if they're not meant for him. Meanwhile, I'm singing an improvised song to distract the little one who cries as soon as I stop looking at him. The sleeves of his t-shirt—though short—are already all stained, he has food everywhere in his hair, and me... I'm on the verge of panicking and starting to cry too.

Welcome to my daily Parental Resource Management. Or as I like to call it: "Terraforming Mars in survival mode with corporations that don't follow any rules."

## 2. Domestic Economy in Free Fall

In a classic resource management game, you start with a balanced board: some credits, base cards, a development plan. In my current family setup, my critical resources are different:

**Energy**: 23% remaining upon waking (if good night), rapid decline with each crisis
**Patience**: Exhaustible stock, recharge time 4-6h (mandatory nap)
**Attention**: Impossible to manage multiple projects simultaneously, constantly arbitrating
**Time**: Daycare deadline non-negotiable, route optimization critical

The problem is that my "opponents" (the children) don't respect any game phase. In Terraforming Mars, at least, other players wait their turn. My children can trigger a crisis while I'm already managing three other emergencies.

And unlike a normal game, you can't pause to plan your strategy.

## 3. Multi-threading Management: Mission Impossible

The morning I describe above? That's real-time multi-threading with processes that constantly crash. In the end, everyone is dressed, fed, and we go out. I leave the house in a state close to a giant meatball storm attack, but that's a problem for later. A later that will come a bit too quickly when we return from our walk... But if an atomic bomb took care of "tidying" my apartment, but the children are happy and doing well, then everything's fine, right?

**Thread 1**: Breakfast preparation (high priority)
**Thread 2**: Baby eating surveillance (critical - choking risk)
**Thread 3**: Toddler diaper change negotiation (urgent - imminent overflow)
**Thread 4**: Stressed dog management (can escalate rapidly)
**Thread 5**: Mom's general state monitoring (resources in free fall)

In my former life as a Cloud Engineer at Ubisoft, I managed infrastructures with thousands of simultaneous users. But here, with my two main "users," I feel like running a 1995 server on which someone installed Cyberpunk 2077.

## 4. Incident Cascade: The Day Everything Collapses

Let's talk about the day my SLAs completely exploded. It was a Tuesday, finally an almost decent night. I wake up optimistic: "Maybe today the system will hold."

**7:15 AM**: First incident. My toddler wakes up and... vomits everywhere in his bed.
**7:18 AM**: Escalation. We go to rinse him, but hot water cut off. My son obviously refuses cold water (I understand him).
**7:45 AM**: Complication. It's THE day both are at daycare and I finally have time for myself. Coffee meeting with a friend planned.
**8:30 AM**: New emergency. On the way to daycare, my dog has trouble with his needs. Poop blockage in his fur preventing him from relieving himself.

You see the pattern. I drop off the children, go home to manage the canine crisis. And at the precise moment when I have my hands in my dog's poop trying to cut excess hair...

The daycare calls. "Hello madam, can you come pick up your older son?"

Game over. My resources were already at zero, my schedule imploded, and that's total stack overflow.

**Typical fork critical example**: The other day, I'm changing my little one when I hear a metallic noise in the kitchen. I ask my older son what he's doing, but the activity is "too exciting" for him to come see me. Result: he wanted to smell all my teas and there's tea everywhere on the floor. An additional incident to manage when I already had my hands full.

## 5. Survival Optimizations

After months of family production incidents, I've developed some optimization strategies:

**Wake-up load balancing**: When the older one wakes up first, I sprint to get him before he wakes his brother. Once they're both up, my CPUs are saturated.

**Ruthless prioritization**: Overflowing diaper = P0 priority. Everything else can wait. Even if it means my tea gets cold and my eggs burn.

**Resource pooling**: My work-from-home husband becomes a shared resource. "Honey, can you handle the barking dog while I negotiate with our recalcitrant toddler?"

**Solution caching**: Invented songs that work, I make a mental playlist. Negotiations that work with the older one, I reuse them (until he updates his behavioral specs). Classic example: cutting his nails = impossible mission, unless I offer him a few minutes of Pokémon in exchange. Pure resource trading: screen time for his cooperation. Win-win until he realizes he can renegotiate contract terms.

**Resource trading**: In Terraforming Mars, you exchange your resources for cards or actions. Here, I trade Pokémon content for parental compliance. The problem is that my "opponent" learns fast and starts asking for bonuses: "Mom, after the nails, can we watch a little more?"

**Tactical diversions**: With the little one who absolutely wants to make percussion with his purée-filled spoon, I pretend to fill a spoon that I let him play with while another is truly devoted to feeding him. Pure diversion strategy.

**Creative delegation**: To keep the older one near me without hand-holding battles: "You push your brother's stroller?" Suddenly, he becomes co-pilot of the mission instead of being a recalcitrant passenger. And for the little one in the stroller: dog leash wrapped around the handlebar, handle in his hands. He thinks he's walking the dog alone. Perfect illusion of control.

## 6. Impossible Scaling: Complexity Explosion

The thing is, in Terraforming Mars, you can develop your engine, optimize your cards, build synergies. In my case, my "projects" grow, but they don't become more efficient - they just develop new, more complex needs, like the most expensive cards in the game.

My toddler now has impossible prerequisites for each action. He wants to help fold laundry (by unfolding everything), empty the machine (into the wrong bin), choose his clothes (dinosaur pajamas mandatory, even to go to daycare).

It's as if in Scythe, your workers suddenly developed opinions about where they want to be deployed and refused to produce resources because they prefer making decorative mechs.

## 7. Critical Resource Starvation: When You Hit Zero

There are moments when all your gauges blink red simultaneously. The other day, at my limit, I went through my entire contact list: "What do you have planned this morning? Park walk together with the kids?" Nobody available. So I sat down on the floor of the balcony with my baby and hoped it would pass. As soon as energy returned, we'd go out.

That's real resource starvation. In Terraforming Mars, when you don't have enough credits, you pass your turn and wait. In my life, when I have no more energy, the children still continue to have needs. No pause button.

Most of the time, I forget myself so much that I have a headache at 5 PM because I haven't drunk all day... while I haven't stopped offering bottles and glasses of water to my children. Faulty resource allocation: I manage all my "users'" needs except mine.

## 8. Investing for the Future: The Parental Tech Tree

In Terraforming Mars, you don't spend all your resources in emergency - you invest part of them to unlock technologies that will help you later. Even in parental survival mode, you sometimes have to sacrifice present resources for future gain.

**Research & development investment**: My husband and I read a lot to understand how to improve our older son's sleep. Time and energy spent (already rare resources), conclusions... limited. He still has trouble falling asleep. With the little one, we gave up - and he falls asleep super easily. Sometimes the solution is not looking for a solution.

**Equipment upgrades**: First stroller received as a gift, wheels that got stuck in mud. I invest in a big-wheel stroller: game changer. Then baby born at 5kg with exponential curve, my back in shambles from carrying. I finally invest in a double stroller. I should have done it much sooner - immediate daily workflow optimization.

**Natural unit evolution**: When your child learns to talk, it's a major system upgrade. Debugging becomes easier: "My tummy hurts" vs indecipherable cry. When he becomes potty-trained, you eliminate the entire diaper task chain. Your "units" evolve and require less maintenance - well, they require it differently.

## 9. Permanent Debug: Parenthood and Systems Engineering

Today, when a crisis breaks out (child crying for no apparent reason), I apply my systems engineering reflexes: I isolate the problem, test different solutions, observe metrics (cries per minute, cheek redness level).

But sometimes debugging reveals unexpected things. The other day, epic tantrum from my older son because he didn't want to put on his shoes. Root cause after investigation: he wanted to put on his Spider-Man socks before his shoes. Undocumented user story: "As a toddler, I want to wear Spider-Man to have superpowers in my feet."

## 10. Lifelong Resource Management

These constrained resource management skills I'm developing daily, I plan to transfer them to my future Product Owner mission. Because ultimately, managing a product roadmap with unpredictable stakeholders, or managing two children with changing needs... same battle.

It's always about optimal allocation of limited resources in an environment that refuses to stabilize. And accepting that sometimes, the best strategy is just to survive the enemy rush while keeping your critical structures standing.

Even with cold tea and burnt eggs.
