# Debugging a Stressed Mare: My First User Empathy Lessons

## 1. Contradictory Users at 8:47 AM

This morning, 8:47 AM, my toddler jumps with both feet in every puddle on the way to daycare. He laughs, splashes, transforms the sidewalk into his personal pool. His shoes are soaked, his pants too, but he radiates happiness.

Yet last night, impossible to convince him to take a bath.

This contradiction reminds me of another user I encountered a few years ago. She also had needs that were incomprehensible at first glance. Vazy, my mare, nicknamed "the princess who must not wet the tip of her hoof" by other riders... but who would go wild in water as soon as it reached past her knee.

Before becoming a mom and preparing for my transition to Product Owner, this black French saddle mare gave me my first real user empathy lesson. And it started with a bug I couldn't fix.

## 2. Critical Bug Detected at 10:15 AM (flashback mode)

It was 10:15 AM that winter Saturday morning when I understood something was really wrong. Not in my code this time - at Ubisoft, my commits were running, my performance was good, my colleagues were nice. No, the bug was elsewhere. Deeper.

I was crying regularly behind my screen without being able to explain why. A recurring incident that I could neither identify nor fix. So I fled to the stable on Saturday mornings, looking for an environment where errors might make more sense.

That's where I met Vazy.

This black French saddle mare was always soaked after her sessions, flanks trembling, ridden by a heavy-handed rider. She had developed this fascinating defense strategy: when she was scared, she would lower her head to charge straight ahead. Exactly like me facing my problems - flee forward, hope it passes.

That morning, I decided to take a break before the doctor would force me to stop. I didn't want to "be weak", I already felt so useless. Unable to showcase my work while my colleagues transformed my one-line commits into incredible feats.

I asked the stable manager if I could work as a groom for a month. Get some air. Understand.

## 3. Behavioral Analysis: A Difficult User

The manager, who had an eye for making horse-rider pairs, regularly had me ride Vazy. At first, it was pure continuous incident management.

**Observed symptoms:**
- Aggressive threats while brushing (managed to tear off a piece of my sweater)
- Total panic when tightening the girth, even gradually
- Categorical refusal of the bit - she would rear up, back up until cornered
- On horseback: unpredictable shying, acceleration under tension, panic U-turns

I was facing a user who violently rejected every interaction, but whose behaviors followed coherent patterns. The problem was that I hadn't yet developed the skills to decrypt them.

A bit like my toddler now: he categorically refuses his bath in the evening when he's dirty, but demands it at any inappropriate hour of the day. When I fill the bathtub, it's always too cold, then too hot, then too cold... while he can stay in ice-cold water until he turns blue.

The needs are there. They're just expressed in a language I don't master yet.

## 4. Continuous Training: Learning the User Language

I couldn't understand if it was mistrust, pain, or something else. Faced with this incomprehension, I did what any good developer does: train myself.

Started with a distance horse-care training. Then I remembered shiatsu. First try: she began to let herself go under my fingers. Positive signal. I continued until becoming a certified equine shiatsu practitioner.

**Plot twist:** I loved it so much that I also started human shiatsu training in parallel. It allowed me to do major work on myself and learn to listen better - to my environment, others, and especially unexpressed needs.

The theory of 5 elements from traditional Chinese medicine taught me the most effective postures to adopt with each personality type. A skill that later helped me enormously with corporate clients.

I rented her for a week, then a month, then a year. And then I couldn't let her go. I bought her.

## 5. The Breakthrough: When the User Finally Trusts You

To celebrate the purchase, I took Vazy on "vacation" to my trainer's place. That's where everything became clear.

The stable offered to swim horses - excellent for the back. Vazy loves water, we thought it would go well. In 20 years, they had only had one reluctant horse.

Vazy fell trying to get out of the pool.

She scared them to death. More fear than harm - just a scratch - but suddenly, everything connected. Her supraspinous ligament was displaced (balance problems), scar on the posterior fetlock, poorly healed rib...

Emergency kinesiology session. Probable diagnosis: overturned in a truck going to competition. Hence her panic fear of obstacles and bells.

When I offered her a shiatsu after that, she began to lean against me. So hard that I was afraid she'd fall on me with her 600kg. It wasn't Robert Redford-style cinema; it was more brutal, more desperate. A simple weight transfer that said everything.

At that moment, I understood. I had my own version of a Ghibli-style trust pact. She wasn't testing my limits like my children do now. She was testing hers. And I was learning to take it upon myself to help her overcome them.

## 6. Iteration and Continuous Improvement

The early days were pure die-and-retry. I fell at least 3 times per session. Each fall was a real-time crash report: shy, panic, U-turn... I analyzed the stack trace of the tumble, patched my posture, and relaunched the sequence. During a jumping lesson, I fell on a bar - segmentation fault, cracked rib.

Budget for washing machine and osteopath exploded, but I wanted to understand how this complex user worked.

**The major insight:** She couldn't stand the contact of a classic bit. I tried something completely crazy for this stable - leather bit, then leather bit without rein.

The change was radical. Vazy relaxed, finally ready to collaborate. We could really start working together. Gradually, I was able to return to a more classic bit, but with a totally different approach.

At that point, we resumed jumping. The mare was transformed. The coach admitted to me several times that he didn't think she would jump that.

## 7. Transferable Lessons: From Riding to Product Management

What Vazy taught me goes far beyond riding:

**User empathy isn't innate, it develops.** Like my debugging skills, it's learned, practiced, refined.

**"Problematic" behaviors often hide legitimate needs poorly expressed.** My toddler who empties the clean machine into the dirty laundry basket? It's not a bug, it's a poorly formulated user story: "As a child, I want to help fold laundry to feel included." The intention is perfect, the implementation needs work.

**Adapt the interface to user needs rather than force the user to adapt.** Vazy's leather bit is a UX pivot. It's accepting that initial specs were based on poor understanding of the need and that iteration is required. It's Product Management 101: the plan isn't sacred, the user is.

**Non-verbal communication carries 80% of the message.** In shiatsu, in parenting, and as a future Product Owner: knowing how to read weak signals from a stakeholder, detect hesitation behind a "yes" in user interviews, understand what doesn't surface in Jira. That's real discovery.

## 8. Permanent Debug: Parenthood and Product

Today, when my baby cries at 3 AM, I no longer just deploy the default "nursing" solution. I debug: hungry? thirsty? too hot? nightmare? teething?

When my older one refuses his bath but demands it at 10 AM, I translate: he wants autonomy over his choices, not necessarily to avoid water.

These user empathy skills developed with Vazy, I plan to transfer them to my future Product Owner mission. Because ultimately, a stressed mare, a stubborn toddler, or a frustrated user... it's the same approach: listen, understand, adapt.

It's always the same fundamental mission: manage a complex and unpredictable system, find the signal in the noise. Whether it's Ubisoft's infrastructure with its thousands of users, a traumatized mare who can't verbalize her pain, or the organized chaos of a constantly evolving family - the challenge remains identical.

And accept that sometimes, the best technical solution isn't the one we had planned from the start.
